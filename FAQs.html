            </p>
        

        Donations to Gaza-donation can best be spent when Gaza-doanation is given the freedom to prioritise spending and allocate funds to programmes and countries that need it most. Experience has shown that restrictions on donations (such as tying them to a region, a programme, a project, a category of person, etc) limit our ability to operate flexibly and that this harms the people we are trying to help. It also involves additional administration. 
        
        UNRWA does however provide several options for donations at present, giving donors the flexibility to contribute to our core programmes or emergency response operations.

      <p class="lead">
        Find answers to common questions about making online donations, supported currencies, credit card options, and online payment safety.
      </p>
         

        HOW CAN I MAKE A DONATION IN A CURRENCY NOT SHOWN ON THE FORM?
        For online donations, which are made by credit card, we can only accept Euro (EUR), pounds sterling (GBP), US dollars (USD) and Brazilian Real (BRL). Limiting the number of currencies for credit card donations helps us reduce administration costs. 
        
        WHAT CREDIT CARDS CAN I USE, AND FOR WHICH CURRENCIES?
        We can take donations via MasterCard, Visa debit and Visa credit. MasterCard and Visa payments are possible in euro (EUR), pounds sterling (GBP), US dollars (USD) and Brazilian Real (BRL). Donations can also be made through PayPal. 
        
        CAN I MAKE A DONATION WITHOUT GIVING ANY PERSONAL DETAILS?
        UNRWA takes great care to protect the personal data of its donors. Any personal data we record is kept confidential. We will not pass it on to anyone for commercial purposes. It is also important that you supply a valid email address in order for us to acknowledge your donation. Read our privacy policy.
        
        HOW CAN I BE CERTAIN THAT MY ONLINE PAYMENT IS SAFE?
        UNRWA takes great care to keep the details you provide for credit card payments confidential. We use Stripe, which ensures an optimum level of security. To prevent fraud, your data is encrypted and then transmitted automatically and directly to the credit card issuer, who processes the payment. 
        
        HOW CAN I BE CERTAIN THAT THE SYSTEM HAS ACCEPTED MY PAYMENT?
        If you have given a valid email address, you will receive an email acknowledging your donation about 15 minutes later. If you do not receive a confirmation email, you can contact us at donation@unrwa.org to request acknowledgement of your donation.

      <p class="lead">
        Learn about the tax deductibility of your donation and how to request an official receipt for tax purposes.
      </p>
        
        IS MY DONATION TO UNRWA TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?
        Donations made directly to UNRWA may not be tax deductible in your country of residence. Laws regarding contributions to United Nations agencies vary from country to country. Please contact your local tax advisor for guidelines on whether your gift is tax deductible. 
        
        You can request an official donation receipt by sending us an email at Show Email. Be sure to give us your full name as it appeared on your donation, your address, the date you made the donation and the amount. It is advisable however that you first contact your local tax advisor for guidelines on whether your gift is eligible and what information should be reflected on the receipt.

        UNRWA’s Commissioner-General is advised by the Advisory Committee on Internal Oversight which includes external members. The Agency is also audited by the independent UN Board of Auditors, which publishes its reports to the General Assembly. The Agency is bound by the principles of best practice of oversight that apply to the United Nations system as a whole.
